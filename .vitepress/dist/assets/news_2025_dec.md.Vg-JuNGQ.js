But that&#39;s not what we are ranting about, it&#39;s the Goddamn Memory Prices!</p><p>I wanted to get a freaking NVMe SSD after acquiring the Mini PC, but guess what?! RAM PRICES TRIPLED, MEMORY PRICES ALSO ON THE RISE, SATAs ARE ALSO AFFECTED, WHAT THE HELL!!!</p><p>Why the hell is the memory prices, skyrocketed to 300%! And of course Micron just yeeted their arse to the AI Boom, while also leaving consumers in the dark.</p><p>The fact that Micron, also tried to get tax cuts, and grants and somehow screwed the consumer market is just shitty move, and if i hope that if in 2028, the United States are finally get a better leader, someone should get an ass whooping because of this, especially you, Sam Altman and others that are driving these hardware costs up.</p><p>Although, i know that there are now some companies that are trying to expand their operation, but their progress is too god-effing slow. And the worst part is that we are now even supporting China (CXMT) to save our asses from greedy western manufacturers.</p><p>If i also remember, the Philippines was also the one manufacturing memory back in the day. What i mostly remember, is TOSHIBA and SAMSUNG having memory industry here. And now we lost some of that capability because of sick greedy f*cks in the government (red-taping, bureaucratic stuff, delays, excessive taxes), scraping more from the industries&#39; profit (and also the middle and low class) and while also supporting corrupt politicians and giving them luxury treatment, while there are people in some parts of the nation that are malnutritioned due to inaccessibility of proper resources due to expensive necessities, or just logistical issues, that could have been solved easily with the same price as a 5 luxury cars. While the rich greedy fks are making their kids look like goliath and baymax but instead of helping, they effing devour sht.</p><p>And major nepo babies in Nepal were beautiful and anything, the common nepo baby size standards in the Philippines are just effing Gorlak&#39;s distant cousins.</p><p>Even with all of this shit exposed, the government has no care at all.
