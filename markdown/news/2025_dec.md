Hello, and this is the December 2025 Newsletter!

Today we are talking about things that happened in 2025 of December. 



## Software Topics


### Mizumo-prjkt is finally back!!!

I (Mizumo-prjkt) has finally came back to try aid A12s Kernel to get the necessary updates and features for general use.

Since my absence back in July 2025, the Galaxy A12s Kernels were stuck having outdated versions of KernelSU and SuSFS, and other 'newer' kernels, seems to be only fit for OneUI Ports by our buddy `fdur25` from Telegram. So now, we are back with the MizKernel Refresh For A12s!

And since then, there was also a GSI port drought which, no new Generic System Images for A12s to be released at that time, and the last stable release was Axion (Android 15) for Samsung Galaxy A12s

There were also some attempts of me coming back in October and November, but since the academics were crashing down on the schedule, it was delayed further until now!!!

|Old Icon|

MizProject's Icon is shifting! Its a meh rating. But at least not worst than the 2024 edition lmao

### SuSFS really backported for A12s?

Right now, the SuSpicious FS (also called SuSFS) have abandoned 4.19 Kernels <Badge type="danger" text="SuSFS 1.5.5"></Badge> , which is also what Galaxy A12s is currently on, until now?.

But i tried to bring the SuSFS 2.0 back to A12s. Which i did. But at a cost of SuSFS module to revert to NonGKI Mode. (Pre-2.x Build)

I am still investigating the issue, and will try to bring full-fledged support of SuSFS 2.0.0 if i can... Just wait for the Next Blogpost

### Some LXC, Chroot and Container shenanigans

Recently, i've seen Ravindu Deshan, a known Samsung Kernel Maintainer who brings Linux Environments like Ubuntu, and Kali, bring up some amazing work on bringing Linux Desktop operating systems running alongside with Android!

I am thinking of Bringing the features of the technology to the A12s community for them to play around. But i believe that the A12s Kernel still had some missing features that may require full chroot environment. But that can/should be easily be solvable!

If the implementation succeeds, then we can stop using `proot` to bring Linux Environment to android, as it's unreliable and sluggish. Full `choot`/`lxc` is the way!

### Rissu is our lord and saviour of Rooting!

:::info
Anyone can provide more context to this section at the Page's repository
:::

Recently, tiann, also known as weishu in Chinese community, known for making twoyi and KernelSU, has declared that they are fully getting rid of Non-GKI and GKI options and leaving LKM as the only way to root devices.

In some rumors, KernelSU Next, forked from KernelSU by rifsxd is also following suit of the decision to get rid of backwards compatibility support. 

However, Rissu with their Rissu-KernelSU, forked from KernelSU, has stepped in and declared that GKI and Non-GKI support will stay. Which means, more devices can still have access to modern rooting, even for older devices that are stuck in Kernel 4.x! Hoorray!!!

After that announcement, SukiSU, who also forked from Rissu-KernelSU, and took some inspirations from APatch for the Kernel Patching, are also following suit.

### Apatch Recommends to only patch your kernel and not rely on "Kernel Maintainers"

::: info
This is a rumor, that some parts may have zero basis, or may be exaggerated. But this section can still be updated. Notify me at Telegram: @Mizumo_prjkt, or update the repo
:::

Apatch Community is advising everyone to only patch your boot images yourselves and not rely on anyone to patch the kernels, as bad actors could try sneaking in malicious code inside the kernel, leaving the user vulnerable.

The process of Patching a boot image requires unpacking the `boot.img` of the device, and edit the kernel to have some root properties to allow having `su` capabilities, similar to KernelSU.

Even though there are some KernelSU Community-based kernel releases, these can be easily seen via repository changes, because to have root, you have to compile the kernel, and most kernel builds released by Maintainers are on Github or GitLab. And any suspicious injections on the Kernel can be spotted by the community via commits.

However, with Apatch, modifiying a kernel, is just involving a patch file, an executable, and a command line without revealing the source code of the kernel, which leaves the 'extras' hidden in plain sight.

APatch Group advises everyone to keep the SuperKey secret at all time and do not trust unknown sources at all costs. And of course, there's shouldn't be a fee to apply APatch on your devices, since its dead easy to patch nowadays....

### The best 'Limewire' app to get songs

::: info
This section is not a paid promotion.
:::

The best Peer-to-Peer app to get music is [Seeker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.companyname.andriodapp1&pcampaignid=web_share). Beats most methods like Downloading Songs from YouTube, which most audios are just not in FLAC.

Helps me harvest a lot of Vocaloid Music in my Galaxy A12s, and found the lossless version of my favourite song, "Nekomimi Switch", "Senbonzakura", "LukaLuka⭐Night Fever", "PianoxFortexScandal". All in flac! YIPEE!

Though, not all songs can be found in Seeker, as if it can't be found, then maybe it's unheard of, or the audio came from an indie band with no publisher.

 This fanfiction, `From the Sekai to Teyvat` is discontinued, check [notes](#discontinuation-of-from-the-sekai-to-teyvat-and-untitled-interastral)
:::

- **From the Sekai to Teyvat** <Badge type="danger" text="Discontinued"></Badge> - A crossover between Genshin Impact and Project Sekai
    - Rated: T-15
    - Synopsis:

        For eons, Asmoday—the Ruler of Space and Time—has watched the script of Teyvat play out. But after countless resets, she faces a terrifying truth: the Traveler alone is not enough. The Abyss inevitably swallows the Throne, and the story always ends in ruin.

        Desperate to save her world, she breaks the one rule: she reaches across the Void for external help.

        She finds a digital universe governed by song. She finds Her.

        A deal is struck with the Administrator of the Sekais. Four souls are stolen from their reality to become the new variables Teyvat desperately needs to break the cycle:

        >The Unifier (Ichika Hoshino)<br>
        >The Star (Tsukasa Tenma)<br>
        >The Idol (Haruka Kiritani)<br>
        >The Void (Mafuyu Asahina)

        But Celestial Miku is not a benevolent god. She demands a tax for her assistance. For every light sent to save Teyvat, a shadow must be cast to ensure the game remains... entertaining.
        While four heroes fall into the wind to save the world, one soul is sent to the Abyss to burn.
        The stage is set. The actors are in place. But can they rewrite a script written by Gods?

:::

- **Untitled: Interastral** <Badge type="danger" text="Discontinued"></Badge> - A story of 4 PJSK characters, stuck in HSR Universe.
    - Rated: R-15
    - Synopsis: 

        Four different rooms. Four different lives. One cosmic error.

        Kanade was composing in the dark, seeking a melody to save a soul. Toya was in his room, seeking a moment of quiet away from expectations. Airi was reviewing practice footage, determined to perfect her routine. Shizuku was simply trying to navigate her phone’s menu.

        At the exact same second, in the heart of Tokyo, they all tapped "Untitled."

        But instead of the familiar digital embrace of Sekai, they are ripped from their homes and thrown onto the cold metal floor of the Herta Space Station. Stranded in a galaxy filled with cosmic horrors, Aeons, and a crisis involving a "Stellaron," the four must band together.

        They are strangers to this world, and in some cases, strangers to each other. But if they want to return to Shibuya, the Composer, the Partner, the Idol, and the Airhead must become something else entirely: Trailblazers.

## Notes/Miscellanous

### Discontinuation of From the Sekai to Teyvat and Untitled: Interastral

This year. From the Sekai to Teyvat and Untitled: Interastral is discontinued.

It is painful to say that i had to discontinue the fanworks, due to how hard it is to balance everything. I now have to maintain devices, catching up with changes about android modding community, and college works.

I really wished to really continue with this but it's becoming unfeasable anymore. I am also considering some options, like rewriting but with a steady pace but it seems in this current situation on my life, its not yet feasible.

I have no problems with anyone picking up the concept and work as i believe free and open expression is for everyone. Even with that weird fetish of having some penetration by a female with a peenar. Or having some weird breakup fetish. 

*damn, Ao3 is getting wilder than i thought back in the day, or maybe i did not dig further enough back then, lol*

Thank you for the support! And i wish everyone a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.

### Rants about Memory Prices and the Corruption in the Philippines

Yo i just recently bought a Mini PC, which i call it, MikuCentre, because i screwed the BIOS's Tables related to Bootsplash and its now stuck at MikuCentre logo, ahahahahahahahahah. But that's not what we are ranting about, it's the Goddamn Memory Prices!

I wanted to get a freaking NVMe SSD after acquiring the Mini PC, but guess what?! RAM PRICES TRIPLED, MEMORY PRICES ALSO ON THE RISE, SATAs ARE ALSO AFFECTED, WHAT THE HELL!!!

Why the hell is the memory prices, skyrocketed to 300%! And of course Micron just yeeted their arse to the AI Boom, while also leaving consumers in the dark.

The fact that Micron, also tried to get tax cuts, and grants and somehow screwed the consumer market is just shitty move, and if i hope that if in 2028, the United States are finally get a better leader, someone should get an ass whooping because of this, especially you, Sam Altman and others that are driving these hardware costs up.

Although, i know that there are now some companies that are trying to expand their operation, but their progress is too god-effing slow. And the worst part is that we are now even supporting China (CXMT) to save our asses from greedy western manufacturers. 

If i also remember, the Philippines was also the one manufacturing memory back in the day. What i mostly remember, is TOSHIBA and SAMSUNG having memory industry here. And now we lost some of that capability because of sick greedy f*cks in the government (red-taping, bureaucratic stuff, delays, excessive taxes), scraping more from the industries' profit (and also the middle and low class) and while also supporting corrupt politicians and giving them luxury treatment, while there are people in some parts of the nation that are malnutritioned due to inaccessibility of proper resources due to expensive necessities, or just logistical issues, that could have been solved easily with the same price as a 5 luxury cars. While the rich greedy fks are making their kids look like goliath and baymax but instead of helping, they effing devour sht.

And major nepo babies in Nepal were beautiful and anything, the common nepo baby size standards in the Philippines are just effing Gorlak's distant cousins. 

Even with all of this shit exposed, the government has no care at all. And they know that the people won't do anything than complain and just stand at a peaceful rally and then they can just wipe it off. It's very frustrating.

::: info
There is also some rumors that we are basically, very-very close to WW3, but rumors are rumors.
